# Kae Oswald

Air element
Was a foster child, and passed around foster homes until she found a stable family at 11.
Has a fear of rejection and abandonment, which she hides by never getting serious with anyone.
If she felt she was getting close to someone, she would get scared and push them away, because she thinks it's better to leave someone than be left behind.

Change for the sake of transformation itself.
With an early childhood of ever changing foster homes, she learns that it is important to adapt to one's enviroment. Kae wants to "live as many lives a possible".
On the surface Kae may be air, but underneath she is more fire.

If she's in she's all in, but her intensity has often shared other people away.
