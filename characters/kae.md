# Kae Oswald

Wind element
Was a foster child, and passed around foster homes until she found a stable family at 11.
Has a fear of rejection and abandonment, which she hides by never getting serious with anyone.
If she felt she was getting close to someone, she would get scared and push them away, because she thinks it's better to leave someone than be left behind.
