Chapter 0: Summary

Dhara Tyagi is studying in her suite with two of her suitemates when the internet goes down. It is the weekend right before finals week. When her boyfriend Ike comes in, with her other suitemate Kae Oswald. Kae's holding her shoes, because her feet is bleeding. She refused to tell her friends why, Ike found her at the school gym just going at in with a punching bag. Dhara makes a joke about how that's not the type of "going at it Kae is accustomed to".

That evening with nothing better to do, because the internet is down Fia proposes they do a game of Dare or Drink while they have some friends from the building over.
Dhara tries to get out of it, saying she rather not be around for the point bras are being worn as bonnets. Ike urges her to stay and saids she can have some fun.

When it's up to Dhara's turn to take a dare, they were on the topic of haunted places. Fia dares Dhara to go to the M level of the Physics building. Kae came along because she still has keys from when she was a physics major and working as a lab technician.

Dhara and Kae sneak into the physics building that night, while they enter the M level and are exploring they come upon a door, curious they give the handle a nudge. A voice, low, raw, and primal bellows "Get out of hereeeeee!" They run, as a figure from the locked door emerges. Around the bend of a corner they get inside a cabinet.
