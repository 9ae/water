In Nova, when Kae and Dhara reunite to go to the lab.

In the elevator ride:
Dhara looks focused, starring intently as the level numbers decrement on the LED panel. "If I can go back in time... I don't mean go home, but like really go back in time in our lives, I would have never taken the dare. A shot of tequila is by far preferable than what we've been through."

"What exactly have we been through," Kae asked too quickly, too sharply, yet there's a shake in her voice, an uncertainty, as if elevator door would open on the next level, and someone would be waiting with a knife right behind her back.

"This ordeal, us, all the mistakes we made together. I wish it would have never happened. It's wrong."

"What is so wrong," asked Kae "with falling in love."
